"""Traffic quotas: a byte ceiling on a Virtual Hub, or on one user's config.

Two kinds of subject, one mechanism. A quota says *how much* may move
(``LimitBytes``), *which direction counts* (``Metric``), and nothing else --
the amount and the unit the operator typed are the same number in bytes by
the time they get here.

**What "used" means.** Exactly what the panel's Transfer column says, and
nothing else. SoftEther counts per hub and per user, cumulatively, from the
moment the object was created, and offers no RPC to zero a counter -- so the
figure the panel shows, and the figure a quota measures, are both

    transfer = raw counter - baseline

with the baseline at zero until somebody resets it. A ceiling set on a config
that has already moved 144 GB therefore starts at 144 GB, not at nothing: the
operator set a ceiling on the number in front of them, and that is the number
it applies to. :func:`reset_transfer` moves the baseline up to the current
reading, which zeroes the panel's Transfer and the quota together, because
they were never two figures to begin with.

The raw reading is cached on the row (``LastSendBytes``/``LastRecvBytes``) so
a list of quotas costs no RPCs; anything looking at *one* subject refreshes it
first, and the enforcement tick refreshes everything it is watching.

**Direction.** The panel's convention throughout: SoftEther's ``Recv`` is what
the subject *downloaded*, its ``Send`` is what the subject *uploaded*.

**What "over" does.** A user over quota has ``policy:Access`` denied and their
live sessions cut; a hub over quota is taken offline. Both are SoftEther's own
switch for "this may not carry traffic", both are reversible, and what was
there before the block is kept in ``RestoreState`` so lifting it puts the
subject back exactly as it was rather than at some assumed default.
