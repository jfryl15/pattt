"""The application: one process serving the API and the built web UI.

The URL space:

    /<web-path>/api/v1/...   the JSON API
    /<web-path>/...          the built frontend (app/web/out)

The web path is a secret prefix read from the database (seeded from the
environment file on first start); empty serves everything at the root. It is
applied by mounting the real application inside an outer shell, so the
application itself never has to know its own prefix.

Around the outside sits the host guard (:mod:`app.hostguard`), which is what
"only serve the panel at its domain" is made of, and beside the main listener
the TLS manager (:mod:`app.services.tls`) runs the HTTPS and port-80
listeners for the same application once a domain is configured.
