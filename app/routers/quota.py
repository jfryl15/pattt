"""Traffic quotas: /quotas/...

A ceiling on how much a Virtual Hub, or one user's config, may move before the
panel cuts it off. The domain lives in :mod:`app.services.quota`; this is the
door to it.

The paths name the subject rather than nesting under the hub router, because a
quota is the panel's own record about a SoftEther object, not a SoftEther
object itself -- and because the user tables want every quota on the server in
one request, which a hub-nested path could not serve.
